# Hangman
In here I'll create a basic hangman game - at first, I'll do it without creating a stickman - but with a twist, using files and serialization to create a state where I can save the game and start anew whenever I wish to.

The save game is created using YAML, it was a challenge to apply the serialization correctly, but I am proud of the end result.
